# Dev Terms

*Here's an [incomplete](https://github.com/joecritch/dev-terms/pulls) list of generic terms thatÂ I've heard developers use. Users of these terms often take them for granted, but they can sometimes increase the barrier of entry for others (especially if non-native English speakers).*

***Note:** I'm not condoning the use of all these terms. (Some might even be slightly cringing.) It's just an attempt to get them all written down and explained.*

## ahead of time

When something is performed "ahead of time", it means that something is done before it's actually needed. Prefetching or eager-loading are equivalents.

## bikeshed

Over-discussing a certain aspect of code which is trivial, such as code formatting. http://bikeshed.com/

## deep dive

When a developer explains some source code, line-by-line. Often on a video or during a talk.

## dogfooding

Working out glitches in an app, often by using the product itself or a related product. Comes from "eat your own dogfood".

## for free

When you get something "for free", this often means that something works automatically, without you having to write some code.

## nit

Not the "National Invitation Tournament" in this case. This is just a developer shortening the term "nit-pick", where they're picking up on the small things, and are potentially being quite subjective. Often found in a pull request, and can often be classed as [bikeshed](#bikeshed)ding.

## ship

Developers like to "ship" things. This means to actually release/deploy it.
